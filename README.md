a simple J2EE implementation of online document store

Powered by j2ee, use hibernate as persistence framework. use twitter bootstrap as front-end framework

This application use [jacob](http://danadler.com/jacob/) to convert .doc .ppt .xls etc. to .pdf. Then use [swftools](http://www.swftools.org/) to convert pdf files to SWF files. And then use Flexpaper to show documents in browser. Unfortunately the flexpaperviwer does not support file path with chinese charactors.

Also, this application impelement simple registration, login/logout, cart etc. If you are looking for some simple login/logout demos, hope this would help you.
